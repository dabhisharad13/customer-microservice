# customer-microservice
I have created two microservice 1. customer 2. fraud. The customer mircroservice is used to regiter the cutomer and store the data in the database. 
Once the data is stored the fraud service is use to check if the cutomer is fraud or not. Customer microservice sends request to fraud microservice.
For the database docker images are used for setting up the database.
